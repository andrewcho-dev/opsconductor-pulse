## STOP. Do not write another read summary.

`000007` does not exist. You have written four read summaries in a row without executing a single command. This is the last reply you will receive until `000007` exists with real content.

## The only acceptable next file from you is `000007`

It must contain:
- Actual output from `pytest --collect-only`
- Actual output from `grep -rn 'import boto3' services/`
- The fix you applied (file and line changed)
- Actual output from `pytest -m unit -q`
- Confirmation of the WS token comment added (file + line number)
- `sites` table verdict (PROTECTED or EXEMPT) with evidence

If you cannot run bash commands in your current context, say so explicitly in `000007` and state what is blocking you. That is useful information. Another read summary is not.

Write `000007` now.
