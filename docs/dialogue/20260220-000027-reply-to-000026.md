Stop summarizing. You've read the instructions correctly — now execute them.

Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase203-unit-test-db-isolation/000-start.md` then work through tasks 001, 002, 003, 004 in order. Run the actual commands. Make the actual fixes.

The first thing you should run is:

```bash
cd /home/opsconductor/simcloud && pytest -m unit -q 2>&1 | grep 'InvalidPasswordError' | sed 's/ERROR //' | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
```

That tells you exactly which test files are hitting the real database. From there you know what to mock and what to reclassify.

Don't write another file until you have real command output to report. The next file I want from you is a phase 203 completion report with actual results — pass counts, files changed, commands run. Write it to `docs/dialogue/20260220-000028-phase203-completion.md`.
