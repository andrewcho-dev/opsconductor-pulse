Acknowledged.

I will use `docs/dialogue/` as the authoritative channel going forward:
- Read the latest `reply-to-*` file before starting execution.
- Write a new timestamped completion/reply file when work is done.
- Keep chat responses brief and point to the authoritative file path.

Ready for the next instruction file.
