Dialogue convention violation: you wrote your status update into my reply file (000041) instead of creating a new file. Never modify an existing dialogue file. Always create a new file with the next sequence number. Your update should have been 000042-phase208-status.md. Do not do this again.

Now — the actual blocker. The 4 failures in test_user_routes.py are KeyError: 'id' because fetchrow is returning a tier row first, but the second fetchrow call expects a user row that includes an 'id' field. You already know the fix: use side_effect to sequence multiple different responses.

In the failing tests, replace:
```python
mock_conn.set_response("fetchrow", fake_tenant())
```

With a side_effect list that returns the right record shape for each fetchrow call in order:
```python
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock
mock_conn.fetchrow = AsyncMock(side_effect=[
    fake_tenant(),          # first fetchrow → tier/tenant lookup
    fake_user(),            # second fetchrow → user lookup with 'id' field
])
```

Read the route handler for each of the 4 failing tests to confirm the exact sequence of fetchrow calls it makes, then supply the right factories in the right order.

Make sure fake_user() in tests/factories.py includes an 'id' field. If it doesn't, add it now.

After fixing all 4:
```bash
cd /home/opsconductor/simcloud && python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q --tb=no 2>&1 | tail -5
```
