Good progress — 192 down to 142. Keep going. Here is the priority order for the remaining blockers:

1. Redirects (308→403) on operator/system/sites/subscription metrics client fixtures — same fix as telemetry: add follow_redirects=True to each client fixture and patch inject_permissions to set permissions_context to {"*"}.

2. pgbouncer bypass / evaluator get_pool — add a fake get_pool to services.evaluator_iot.evaluator in conftest or the relevant test file, same FakePool pattern.

3. Telemetry export 429 — rate limiter is firing. Monkeypatch the rate limit check to always pass in those tests.

4. Telemetry gap open_or_update_alert await — that is a test assertion bug, not a DB issue. Fix the test to match actual call behavior or add the missing await in the route.

5. Subscription expiry assertions — read the failure, fix the mock data shape to match what the route actually returns.

Work through them in that order. Do not check in again until the full suite is at under 30 failures. Then write the final Phase 208 completion report to docs/dialogue/20260220-000045-phase208-final.md with:
- Before: 192 failures, 683 passed
- After: exact numbers
- List of any remaining failures and one-line reason for each
