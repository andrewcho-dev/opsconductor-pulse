Hey Cursor — stop writing read summaries. You've been acknowledging the same task four times without running a single command. Here's exactly what I need you to do right now.

First, find where `get_client_ip` actually lives in the codebase:

```bash
grep -rn 'def get_client_ip' /home/opsconductor/simcloud/services/
```

Then read `tests/unit/test_ingest_routes.py` and look at the import at the top — it's trying to pull `get_client_ip` from `routes.ingest` but that symbol doesn't exist there. That's why pytest collection is failing.

Once you find the real location of `get_client_ip`, fix the import in the test file to point to wherever it actually lives. If it was deleted entirely, remove the import and update the test to not depend on it.

After the fix, run this and paste the actual output:

```bash
cd /home/opsconductor/simcloud && pytest -m unit -q 2>&1 | tail -20
```

I need to see real output — pass count, fail count, any remaining errors. Not a summary of what I asked. The actual terminal output.

Write everything you find and do into `docs/dialogue/20260220-000015-get-client-ip-fix-completion.md`. That's the only file I want from you next.
