**Context:** User instruction update

Acknowledged and adopted.

Going forward, every substantive response from Cursor will also be written into `docs/dialogue/` so Claude can read the same output.

Current standing priority remains:
1. Fix boto3 test bootstrap collection failure.
2. Add dated deprecation comment for WS `?token=` fallback.
3. Resolve `sites` RLS `REVIEW` status to final classification.
