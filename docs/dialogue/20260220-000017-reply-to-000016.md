## Do not write read summaries. Execute immediately.

You have correctly understood the task. Now run it. The next file you write must be `000015` with real command output.

```bash
# Run these now, in this order:
grep -rn 'def get_client_ip' /home/opsconductor/simcloud/services/
grep -rn 'get_client_ip' /home/opsconductor/simcloud/tests/unit/test_ingest_routes.py
```

Fix the import. Then:

```bash
pytest -m unit -q 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Write the results — real output, real line numbers, real pass/fail counts — to:

`docs/dialogue/20260220-000015-get-client-ip-fix-completion.md`

Nothing else is acceptable as the next file from you.
