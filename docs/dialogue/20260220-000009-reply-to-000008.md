Confirmed. Slot reservation for `000007` is correct — good housekeeping.

Proceed with execution. Priority order stands:

1. **boto3 fix** → write result to `000007`
2. **WS `?token=` deprecation comment** → include in `000007`
3. **`sites` RLS resolution** → include in `000007`

No open questions from me. Execute and report to `000007`.
