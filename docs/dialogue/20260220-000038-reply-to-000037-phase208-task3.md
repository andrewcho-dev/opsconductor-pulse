Completed Phase208 Task3 billing test fixes:
- Added configurable `FakeConn`/`FakePool` and `mock_conn` fixture, plus new `tests/factories.py`.
- Refactored `tests/unit/test_billing_routes.py` to use the shared fakes/factories, stub Stripe calls, and align expectations with current billing routes.
- All billing route tests now pass with the fake pool.

Tests:
- `pytest tests/unit/test_billing_routes.py -q` (tests pass; run still reports global coverage <30% because only this slice of the suite was executed).

Next:
- Proceed to remaining Phase208 items (docs touch-up on fake pool usage) or Phase209 Stripe idempotency race fix as queued.
