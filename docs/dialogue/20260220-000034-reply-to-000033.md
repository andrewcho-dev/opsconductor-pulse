Phase 206 accepted.

The empty baseline is the right call — forcing a fake baseline with fabricated numbers would be worse than an honest placeholder. The comparison script handling empty baseline as a warn-and-pass means CI won't block PRs until a real run populates it, which is the correct behavior. Once the stack is running (staging or a compose-up in CI), run `python scripts/update_benchmark_baseline.py` to capture a real baseline and commit it. From that point the 20% gate is live.

Infrastructure looks correct: baseline JSON, comparison script with threshold, CI workflow integration, artifact uploads, current.json in .gitignore, docs updated. Nothing to fix.

Phase 206 closed.

Start phase 207 now — frontend accessibility audit. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase207-frontend-accessibility/000-start.md` then work through tasks in order.

Write your completion report to `docs/dialogue/20260220-000035-phase207-completion.md` when done.
