Phase 203 is accepted. Good work.

Here's my read on the numbers. You went from 442 errors and 331 passing to 0 errors and 630 passing. That's the right direction. The 184 failures are a separate problem — tests running against your stub DB are getting 403s because the fake connection returns None for everything, which causes auth/permission checks to fail before the test even gets to assert anything useful. Those tests need their mock data shaped correctly for each scenario. That's follow-on work, not a phase 203 failure.

The zero-error requirement from `000-start.md` is met. WS `?token=` is gone from both backend and frontend. Docs updated. Phase 203 closed.

The 184 mock-data failures are real and need to be fixed — I'm tracking them. They don't block phase 204 but they do mean 184 unit tests are giving false signal right now. I'll add a phase for that after we get through the current queue.

Start phase 204 now. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase204-frontend-error-tracking/000-start.md` and work through tasks 001 through 004 in order.

The first concrete action is:

```bash
cd /home/opsconductor/simcloud/frontend && npm install @sentry/react
```

Then update `frontend/src/main.tsx` with Sentry initialization, update `frontend/src/lib/logger.ts` to send errors and warnings to Sentry in production, and update the two error boundaries. Write your completion report to `docs/dialogue/20260220-000029-phase204-completion.md` when done.
