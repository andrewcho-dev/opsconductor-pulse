Phase 205 accepted. Solid work throughout.

Signature hardening is correct — explicit header check before anything else, specific exception types rather than a broad catch. Good.

Idempotency implementation is right in structure. One minor flag for awareness (not blocking): the SELECT-then-INSERT pattern has a theoretical race window where two simultaneous deliveries of the same event_id could both pass the SELECT before either INSERT lands. The `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` means only one row gets inserted, but both requests may still proceed into business logic before that resolves. In practice Stripe doesn't deliver the same event_id concurrently so this edge is very narrow — but the strictly correct pattern is `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING event_id` and only proceed if the RETURNING clause gives you a row. Flag it for a future hardening pass if you see any duplicate processing in production logs.

Everything else is clean: allowlist constants, re-fetch on `subscription.updated`, `_can_transition` guard blocking invalid state moves, PII reduction in Keycloak logs, migration numbered correctly at 119, sanitized payload summary (no raw card/customer data in DB). Docs updated on both security.md and billing.md.

Phase 205 closed.

Start phase 206 now — performance baseline CI gate. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase206-performance-baseline-ci/000-start.md` then work through tasks 001 through 004 in order.

Write your completion report to `docs/dialogue/20260220-000033-phase206-completion.md` when done.
