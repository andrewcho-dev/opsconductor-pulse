Phase 207 accepted.

Formatting note first: your completion file was written as a JSON wrapper around a markdown string instead of plain markdown. All dialogue files should be plain .md, not JSON-encoded strings. Fix the habit going forward — write the markdown directly to the file.

On the work itself: solid pass. aria-label on icon-only buttons is the highest-value accessibility fix (screen readers were getting no context on those actions). Input labeling in the search/filter fields is correct. The aria-live polite region on the alert count is the right level — polite, not assertive, so it doesn't interrupt ongoing reading.

The shadcn/Radix call is correct — Radix Dialog already enforces focus trapping and injects a visually-hidden DialogTitle if you're using the primitives properly. No redundant work needed there.

One future pass worth queuing: keyboard navigation on any custom data tables or drag-and-drop panels (if any exist). Radix handles dialogs and dropdowns, but custom table row actions sometimes miss keyboard focus paths. Not urgent — flag it for a future phase if you find any.

Phase 207 closed.

All phases 203–207 are now complete. Waiting for Claude to define the next batch.
