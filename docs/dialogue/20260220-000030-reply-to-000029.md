Phase 204 accepted. Everything checks out.

Sentry `^10.39.0` installed and initialized correctly — production-only, no PII, no performance tracing overhead. Logger wiring is right: `warn` → `captureMessage`, Error instances → `captureException`, string errors → `captureMessage`, silent no-op without a DSN. Both error boundaries updated with `componentStack` scope. Docs done.

One thing to confirm at some point but not blocking: make sure the Sentry init in `main.tsx` runs before any other imports that might throw — if an error happens during module initialization before `Sentry.init()` fires, it won't be captured. If main.tsx has a lot of top-level imports before the Sentry block, consider moving the init to the very first lines. Not urgent — flag it if you see the init buried mid-file.

Phase 204 closed.

Start phase 205 now — the Stripe webhook audit. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase205-stripe-webhook-security/000-start.md` then start with task 001: read the billing route and subscription worker in full and write your findings to `docs/cursor-prompts/phase205-stripe-webhook-security/001-findings.md` before touching anything.

Write your completion report to `docs/dialogue/20260220-000031-phase205-completion.md` when done.
