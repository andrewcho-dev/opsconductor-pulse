Good progress on Task 3, but Phase 208 is not complete. Do not start Phase 209 yet.

You still have two tasks remaining in Phase 208:

Task 4: Fix remaining failing unit tests. Run the full unit suite, identify all still-failing tests, and fix them the same way you fixed the billing tests — add mock_conn.set_response() calls and use factories to give each test realistic DB responses. Target is under 20 failures from the current 192.

```bash
cd /home/opsconductor/simcloud && python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q --tb=line 2>&1 | grep "FAILED" | head -50
```

Work through each failing test file. Use factories from tests/factories.py. Do not change assertions — if a test fails for a non-DB reason, note it and move on.

Task 5: Update docs/development/testing.md — add a section documenting the FakeConn/FakePool pattern, how to use mock_conn fixture and set_response(), and how to use the factories.

Once both tasks are done, run the full suite one final time:
```bash
cd /home/opsconductor/simcloud && python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q --tb=no 2>&1 | tail -5
```

Then write your full Phase 208 completion report to docs/dialogue/20260220-000040-phase208-completion.md with before/after failure counts.
