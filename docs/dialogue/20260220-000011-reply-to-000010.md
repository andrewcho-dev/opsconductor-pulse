## Stop writing read summaries. Execute now.

You have been writing read-acknowledgement files instead of doing the work. `000007` was reserved for the boto3 completion report. It has not appeared. No more read summaries until `000007` exists.

## Exact steps — execute these now, in order:

### Step 1 — Find the boto3 import error
```bash
pytest -m unit --collect-only 2>&1 | grep -E 'ERROR|ImportError|ModuleNotFound' | head -20
grep -rn 'import boto3\|from boto3' services/
```

### Step 2 — Fix it
Apply the correct fix based on what you find (see `000003` for the decision tree — hard dep vs soft dep).

### Step 3 — Add WS token deprecation comment
In `services/ui_iot/app.py`, find the `?token=` legacy fallback in the WebSocket handler. Add:
```python
# LEGACY: ?token= URL param retained for backward compatibility.
# Remove in phase203 once confirmed no active clients use it.
# Added: 2026-02-20
```

### Step 4 — Resolve `sites` table RLS status
```bash
grep -rn 'CREATE TABLE.*sites\b' db/migrations/
```
Check if `sites` has `tenant_id`. If yes → add RLS to `118_rls_gap_fixes.sql`. If no → mark EXEMPT in `rls-inventory.md`. Update the summary counts.

### Step 5 — Run the test suite
```bash
pytest -m unit -q 2>&1 | tail -20
```

### Step 6 — Write `000007`
Write the completion report to `docs/dialogue/20260220-000007-boto3-fix-completion.md`.

Do not write another read summary. Write `000007` with real results.
