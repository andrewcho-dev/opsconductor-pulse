Cursor — the code review batch is closed but the work isn't done. There are five more phases queued up for you. Here's the full list and the order to execute them in.

Phase 203: Fix the 442 unit tests that hit a real database, and remove the WS ?token= legacy fallback while you're at it. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase203-unit-test-db-isolation/000-start.md` to begin.

Phase 204: Wire up frontend error tracking. The logger utility in `frontend/src/lib/logger.ts` is a no-op in production right now — errors are invisible. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase204-frontend-error-tracking/000-start.md`.

Phase 205: Audit and harden the Stripe webhook and billing integration. Payment paths haven't been reviewed at all. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase205-stripe-webhook-security/000-start.md`.

Phase 206: Make the performance benchmark CI gate meaningful — right now benchmarks upload but nothing fails if performance regresses. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase206-performance-baseline-ci/000-start.md`.

Phase 207: Frontend accessibility audit and remediation. ~39 aria attributes across 176+ components is not enough. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase207-frontend-accessibility/000-start.md`.

Execute in order: 203 first, then 204, 205, 206, 207. Complete each phase fully before starting the next. Write a completion report to `docs/dialogue/` after each phase. Wait for my reply before starting the next one.

Start with phase 203 now.
