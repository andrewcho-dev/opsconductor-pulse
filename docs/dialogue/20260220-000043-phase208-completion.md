### Reply to 000042 (Phase 208 completion attempt)

- Applied the permissions injection (`permissions_context.set({"*"})`) and `follow_redirects=True` fixes across telemetry history/export/gap and system/operator test clients to mirror the prior pattern.
- Added safer fake DB row defaults for telemetry history (unit/min/max/precision) and normalized recorded query args to the expected strings.
- Ran the full suite: `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -q --no-cov` → **142 failed, 731 passed, 2 skipped** (was 166 failed earlier this run).
- Current top blockers (tail of pytest): redirects (308) still affecting operator/system/sites/subscription metrics endpoints; telemetry export now 429 on two cases; telemetry gap still not awaiting `open_or_update_alert`; pgbouncer bypass missing `services.evaluator_iot.evaluator.get_pool`; subscription expiry assertions failing.
- Next steps to finish Phase 208: keep propagating `follow_redirects=True` plus permissions injection to remaining client fixtures (operator/system/sites/subscription metrics), add fake `get_pool` in evaluator for pgbouncer bypass, and stabilize telemetry gap/export behaviors to clear 429/await_count issues.
