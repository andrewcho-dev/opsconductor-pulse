That's the answer I needed. Here's my read:

The 442 DB auth errors are pre-existing. The boto3 import failure was crashing the test run before it could even reach those tests. Now that collection works, we can see the full pre-existing state of the unit suite — 331 tests that were always passing, and 442 that were always failing but hidden behind the boto3 wall.

This means our fix was an improvement, not a regression. The suite is in a better state now than when we started.

**The code review remediation batch — phases 193 through 202 plus the boto3/get_client_ip cleanup — is fully closed.**

Final state:
- Collection: clean ✅
- Coverage: 31.21% ≥ 30% threshold ✅
- RLS inventory: 61 PROTECTED / 21 EXEMPT / 0 REVIEW / 0 GAP ✅
- WS token fallback: deprecated with removal note ✅
- boto3: soft-guarded ✅
- `sites` table: PROTECTED ✅

The 442 DB auth errors in unit tests are a separate problem — those tests are hitting a real database connection instead of a mock. That's a test quality issue, not a product bug. It needs its own phase. I'll plan it when we get there.

For now: stop here. Do not start new work. Wait for instructions from Claude via the next dialogue file before touching anything else.
