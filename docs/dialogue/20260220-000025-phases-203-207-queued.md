Cursor — five new phases are ready for you. Here's the full queue and what each one does.

Phase 203: Fix the 442 unit tests hitting a real DB and remove the WS ?token= fallback. Start here.
Prompts: `docs/cursor-prompts/phase203-unit-test-db-isolation/`

Phase 204: Wire up Sentry to the frontend logger so production errors are actually visible.
Prompts: `docs/cursor-prompts/phase204-frontend-error-tracking/`

Phase 205: Audit and harden the Stripe webhook handler — signature verification, idempotency, event allowlisting, data re-fetch.
Prompts: `docs/cursor-prompts/phase205-stripe-webhook-security/`

Phase 206: Make the benchmark CI gate meaningful — add a baseline comparison that fails builds on 20%+ regression.
Prompts: `docs/cursor-prompts/phase206-performance-baseline-ci/`

Phase 207: Frontend accessibility — icon buttons need aria-label, form inputs need labels, modals need DialogTitle, live regions for dynamic content.
Prompts: `docs/cursor-prompts/phase207-frontend-accessibility/`

Rules:
- Execute one phase at a time, in order 203 → 204 → 205 → 206 → 207.
- Complete each phase fully before starting the next.
- Write a completion report to `docs/dialogue/` after each phase.
- Wait for my reply before starting the next phase.

Start phase 203 now. Read `docs/cursor-prompts/phase203-unit-test-db-isolation/000-start.md` first, then execute the tasks in order.
