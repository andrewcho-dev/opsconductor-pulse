# Phase 143: IoT SaaS Platform UI Design Research

## Purpose

Comprehensive competitive analysis of UI design patterns across 7 major IoT/infrastructure monitoring platforms. This research informs design decisions for OpsConductor-Pulse's UI overhaul.

## Deliverables

- `001-platform-research.md` -- Per-platform design analysis (AWS, Azure, Google, Losant, ThingsBoard, Datadog, Grafana)
- `002-synthesis-and-recommendations.md` -- Cross-platform patterns and specific recommendations for OpsConductor-Pulse

## How to Use

This is a **research document**, not an execution prompt. Use the synthesis in `002-synthesis-and-recommendations.md` as the design specification foundation for any future UI redesign phases.
