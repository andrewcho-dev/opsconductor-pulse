# Task 2: Update Documentation

## Files to Update

1. `docs/development/frontend.md`
2. `docs/services/ui-iot.md`
3. `docs/features/device-management.md`
4. `docs/index.md`

---

## All Files

### Frontmatter (all four)

- Set `last-verified: 2026-02-20`
- Add `191` to the `phases` array

### Content Changes

**`docs/features/device-management.md`** — Update the Data tab module description:

```markdown
Expansion modules use a collapsible `<details>` section, closed by default when no modules are assigned (showing a one-line summary). The slot list is width-constrained to prevent full-width stretching.
```

**Other files** — No content changes, frontmatter only.

## Verification

- All four docs have `191` in their `phases` array
- `last-verified` dates updated
