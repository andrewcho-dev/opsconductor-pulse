# Phase 81 — Fleet Overview Homepage Redesign

## Overview
Replace the current DashboardPage with a proper fleet-first homepage that mirrors
AWS IoT Device Management and Azure IoT Central. The homepage becomes a real-time
operational command center: KPI strip at top, site health map in the middle,
active alert feed and recently updated devices in side-by-side panels below.

No backend changes needed — all data already exists.

## Execution Order
1. 001-kpi-strip.md — KPI strip component (top of page)
2. 002-layout.md — Full homepage layout redesign
3. 003-verify.md — Build check + checklist
